                <p>Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</em> that aims to bring the frozen north into your home. Whether you want to call it immersion, realism, role-playing, or simple masochism, the end-goal is to make you actually feel like an intrepid adventurer climbing snow-covered mountains, delving into ancient ruins, and getting your bits bitten off by packs of hungry wolves.</p>
<p>Wildlander is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.</p>
<p>Wildlander is also a mod in its own right, as it includes proprietary features not available in the original mods.</p>
<p>The whole experience is built around <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888" rel="nofollow">Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul</a> - v5.0.3. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices.</p>
<p>In general, any Requiem resources you find will be applicable to Wildlander. Some information may be outdated, some may be overwritten by other mods in Wildlander, and some may have been disabled entirely, but the core principles are the same.</p>
<p>Wildlander can be overwhelming at first, so I highly recommend reading up on it. Start with The Recommended reading section on this wiki and work down from there.</p>

<p>If you have played a character already and then exit to the main menu, do not attempt to start a new character in the same session. Instead, quit entirely out of Skyrim and restart it from there. If you do not do so, the game will not operate properly and you will get errors such as 'please restart the economy,' or 'Honed Metal has crashed.'</p>
<p>This <em>isn't</em> a bug with the list. Skyrim does not handle you playing one character, returning to the menu and starting a second. This is because skyrim doesn't unload all of the previous games scripts and can cause severe issues with your new playthrough (hotkeys not working, broken economy, merchants with no gold, or even your character leveling up when they shouldn't be).</p>
<p>Everytime you want to start a new character, you should be closing and reopening skyrim in its entirety.</p>
<p>Please <em>DO NOT</em> report bugs relating to this topic as its a flaw with skyrim itself. There is nothing we can do to make this work!</p>
